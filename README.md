<p>I'm Gabriele. I have always been intrigued by fields such as programming and technology, so much so that <strong>today Iâ€™m Junior Full Stack Web Developer</strong>, :computer: with an educational background and <strong>skills in the Graphic Design field</strong>. :pencil2: :triangular_ruler:</p>
<p>Iâ€™m constantly stimulated by new experiences, and I really enjoy teamwork. In fact, I am convinced that a good project, at the customer's disposal, comes from the collaboration of several professionals, as well as from the quality of the coding.</p>
