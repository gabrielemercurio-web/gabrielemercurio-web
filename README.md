<h1>Hey there ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>I'm Gabriele. I have always been intrigued by fields such as programming and technology, so much so that today Iâ€™m Junior Full Stack Web Developer, with an educational background and skills in the Graphic Design field. Iâ€™m constantly stimulated by new experiences, and I really enjoy teamwork. In fact, I am convinced that a good project, at the customer's disposal, comes from the collaboration of several professionals, as well as from the quality of the coding.
